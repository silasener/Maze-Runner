# Maze-Runner
A game has been designed that allows a robot, which operates according to certain rules, to overcome obstacles in front of it and reach the desired target via the shortest path. The game involves two problems. The first problem creates a maze based on information it reads from two different URLs, and places three different types of obstacles in the necessary places. The second problem involves creating a random maze of the size given by the user, and placing only type 1 obstacles in the appropriate places. In both problems, the scanned paths and the shortest path are displayed in the interface, while information such as time and number of squares is printed on the screen.
